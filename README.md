--------------------------------
Given a maze with the following structure
###########

Please write a program that can solve the maze. The blank characters
represent empty space and the hash character (#) represents a wall.
The cursor is unable to travel through a wall, but is able to travel
in blank space.
The cursor must start on the S character and is not finished until
it
lands on the F character.
The program should take one parameter, the maze in text format and
should print the solved maze upon completion and exit.
